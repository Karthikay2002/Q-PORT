# Q-Port: Quantum Portfolio Optimization

**Q-Port** is a quantum-inspired solution to portfolio optimization that leverages the power of quantum computing techniques, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) and Quantum Hamiltonians, to achieve efficient, high-performing portfolio selections. It compares quantum-based strategies with classical approaches to highlight the potential of quantum algorithms in real-world finance.

## **Overview**

Portfolio optimization is a crucial task in finance, involving the selection of assets that maximize returns while minimizing risk. Classical methods face limitations when handling complex datasets or scaling to higher dimensions. 

**Q-Port** introduces quantum algorithms to solve this challenge by:
- Exploring multiple portfolio combinations simultaneously using quantum superposition.
- Encoding optimization problems into quantum Hamiltonians, where the lowest energy state represents the optimal portfolio.
- Balancing risk and return using tunable parameters.
